3D model assets are not bundled due to large file size. The project initializer attempts to download the 3D models, however if this fails they must be manually downloaded and added to this folder to use. Model assets can be found here: https://github.com/frc-web-components/frc-web-components/tree/master/packages/fwc/public/3d-models
